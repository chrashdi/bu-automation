Project Brief: EOL Sentinel1. Executive SummaryEOL Sentinel is a lightweight, internal dashboard designed for Private Equity IT auditing. It tracks the "End of Life" (EOL) status of software components across various portfolio products.The system allows an admin to log in, define internal products (e.g., "Aurea ACRM"), and map them to specific external software dependencies (e.g., "SQL Server 2016"). The application then automatically fetches live EOL dates from the open-source endoflife.date API to calculate risk.2. Tech StackFrontend Framework: Next.js 14+ (App Router)Styling: Tailwind CSS (Shadcn/UI recommended for speed)Backend/Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL)File Storage: Supabase Storage (for product logos)External Data: endoflife.date APIAuthentication: Next.js Middleware (Hardcoded Basic Auth)3. Core Features & User FlowPhase 1: Authentication (Hardcoded)Mechanism: Middleware intercepting /dashboard/* routes.Credentials: admin / password123 (stored in .env).Flow: User visits site -> Redirected to simple Login Form -> Enters credentials -> Cookie set -> Redirected to Dashboard.Phase 2: Product Management (The Container)Action: User clicks "Add Product".Input: Product Name (e.g., "Aurea Monitor"), Logo Upload.Storage: Logos uploaded to Supabase Storage bucket product-logos.Display: Dashboard shows a grid of Product Cards.Phase 3: Component Tracking (The Logic)Action: Inside a Product Card, user clicks "Add Component".Input: 1.  Display Name: (e.g., "Database Layer")2.  API Slug: (e.g., mssqlserver - matching endoflife.date endpoint)3.  Version: (e.g., 2016)Logic: The app validates the slug against the API (optional) and saves the record.Phase 4: The Dashboard (Risk View)Visuals: * Green: > 1 year remaining.Yellow: < 1 year remaining.Red: EOL date passed.Data Fetching: On page load, the app iterates through saved components, hits https://endoflife.date/api/{slug}.json, finds the matching version object, and compares the eol date to today.4.

API Integration LogicEndpoint: GET https://endoflife.date/api/{slug}.jsonSample Response for Slug mssqlserver:[
  {
    "cycle": "2016",
    "releaseDate": "2016-06-01",
    "eol": "2026-07-14",
    "latest": "13.0.7037.1"
  },
  {
    "cycle": "2014", ...
  }
]
Frontend Logic:Fetch full JSON list for the slug.Filter list where item.cycle === component.version.Parse item.eol date.Calculate Days Remaining = (EOL_Date - Today).6. Implementation StepsSetup Supabase:Create project.Run SQL to create tables.Create logos bucket and set policy to Public.Next.js Init:npx create-next-app@latest eol-sentinelBuild Auth Middleware:Create middleware.ts to check for a specific cookie.Create app/login/page.tsx to set that cookie.Build Dashboard UI:Create Product Grid.Create "Add Product" Modal (handle image upload).Build Component Logic:Create "Add Component" form.Write the utility function to fetch and parse endoflife.date data.
